# Advent of Code 2025
> I've done the Advent of Code 2025 (AOC) in Python. It's basically an advent calendar composed of programming puzzles that you can solve in every type of language you want. A puzzle made give one star and each problem consist of two puzzles, a first one, and then a continuation of this one that is harder to solve. You have an input you need to download and parse to later get the expected result. The difficulty is generally increasing as each day passes. Here is the website of this challenge to see the problems : https://adventofcode.com/.

## Virtual Environnment
Since the libraries are not installed on my Mac, I need to set up a virtual environment to access and use the required libraries, the process might be different depending on your device, here is how to do :

Creating the virtual environnment
```
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
```
Activating the virtual environnment
```
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
```
Downloading the librairies you need in the virtual environnment
```
python3 -m pip install what_you_need
```
To temporarly deactivate the virtual environnment
```
deactivate 
```
