# Advent of Code
> This repository contains my different solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual programming challenge held in December.
> Every day from December 1st to 25th, a new puzzle is released. Each puzzle consists of two parts: the first one gives you a star ⭐, and the second one (a harder continuation) gives you another ⭐.  
> The problems can be solved in any programming language, and the difficulty usually increases as the days progress.  
> 
> Each year has its own sub-repository in this project, with the solutions written in different languages depending on my mood and experiments for that year.
